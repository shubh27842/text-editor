## Description

I started this project by using the 'create-react-app' boilerplate, then adding `bootstrap` and `material-ui` for styling and using prebuilt components and icons from bootstrap and material-ui respectively.

I have used `draft-js` in this project for creating editor state

The most challenging task in this project is to learn and implement `draft-js` a rich-text-editor provided by facebook, but got easy at end the end by great documentation available at https://draftjs.org/ 

Here in this application there are feature like `word count`, `readability score` by Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease formula, some keywords implemented for particular keys and `power word` these all are important while creating a good blog.
